The six different lotteries are presented below. You have to select one and only one of these lotteries. Which outcome occurs for each of the six lotteries depends on the roll of a ten-sided die. Each outcome has a 50% chance of occurring depending on the roll. If the roll is 1,2,3,4 or 5 the outcome is 'Low'. If the roll is 6,7,8,9 or 10, the roll is 'High'. Between Lotteries A, B, C, D, E and F, which lottery do you prefer?
Lottery A: Winning £28 if the roll is 'low' (i.e., die roll is 1,2,3,4 or 5), or £28 if the roll is 'high' (i.e., die roll is 6,7,8,9 or 10)
Lottery B: Winning £24 if the roll is 'low' (i.e., die roll is 1,2,3,4 or 5), or £36 if the roll is 'high' (i.e., die roll is 6,7,8,9 or 10)
Lottery C: Winning £20 if the roll is 'low' (i.e., die roll is 1,2,3,4 or 5), or £44 if the roll is 'high' (i.e., die roll is 6,7,8,9 or 10)
