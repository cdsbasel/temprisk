#### ABOUT

**Panel Name:** Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)

**Description:** The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers across the United States of America. MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers. The number of families recruited have ranged from around 8,000 to 15,000. The survey was launched in 1996 and continues to collect data until today on an annual basis. Data is also collected from respondents who participated in two surveys (approx. a year a part).
