# Comparing the Temporal Stability and Convergent Validity of Risk Preference Measures: A Meta-Analytic Approach


* **var_info:** xlsx. and .csv files with the list of variables and risk measures for each panel/sample to pre-process and include in the analyses. Includes codebook of risk preference measures.

* **pre_processing**
 + code:scripts to select variables of interest and pre-process/clean the data from each panel/sample


* **processing**
 + code:
   + temp_stability: scripts to compute test-retest correlations for each panel/sample
   + convergent_val: scripts to compute inter-correlations for each panel/sample
  + output:
   + temp_stability: .csv files with test-retest correlations for each panel/sample
  + convergent_val: .csv files with inter-correlations for each panel/sample


* **analysis**
  + code:
     + temp_stability: scripts to conduct the analyses on temporal stability
     + convergent_val: scripts to conduct the analyses on convergent validity
  + output:
     + temp_stability: output of the analyses on temporal stability
    + convergent_val: output of the analyses on convergent validity


* **plotting**
  + code:
    + temp_stability: scripts to plot test-retest correlations and analysis results.
    + convergent_val: scripts to plot inter-correlations and analysis results.
  + output:
    + temp_stability: .png files of figures incldued in the manuscript
    + convergent_val: .png files of figuresincldued in the manuscript



* **Running the scripts**
 + Details of how to run the above scripts and replicate the analyses reported in the manuscript can be found on the companion website.
